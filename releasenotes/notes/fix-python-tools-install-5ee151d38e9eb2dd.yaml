    Set the default version to 'python3' instead of '3.8.x' since some of the
    older images may not have the specifc version installed. The default
    version is only used when lf-env.sh is not available.

    CR I821a86ac3b54f2 sets and uses python 3.x version made available by pyenv
    therefore remove the --user option which is no longer required.
