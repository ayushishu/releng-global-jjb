    Fix rtd-verify.sh to better validate submodules. rtd-verify.sh was using
    "git submodule" commands to validate submodules, but Jenkins reads the
    .gitmodules file and executes a "git config" command for each submodule.
    Because of this, if a bad submodule was added to .gitmodules, it would pass
    verify but cause failures on subsequent builds after it was merged.

    This change closes that loophole by reading the .gitmodules file, and
    then running through the same "git config" command for each submodule
    that Jenkins runs when pulling in the main branch.
