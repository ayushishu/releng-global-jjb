    Echo error response from RTD without formatting.  The script
    rtd-trigger-build.sh starts a build at ReadTheDocs and parses
    the response, a small JSON like this:

    {"build_triggered":false,"project":"unicorn","versions":[]}

    This change drops the invocation of jq that attempts to pretty-print
    the JSON to the log when the build is not triggered, because that
    call was failing for inexplicable reasons.
