    Fix Job key in commit message body rather than trailers section
    (AKA footer). The commit message produced by gerrit-push-patch which
    currently creates a commit message where the Job key appears in the commit
    message body rather than the trailer.

    For example::

        An example commit message

        Job: builder-job/123

        Change-Id: 1234567
        Signed-off-by: Jenkins <jenkins@example.org>

    This fixes it to::

        An example commit with proper trailer

        Job: builder-job/123
        Change-Id: 123457
        Signed-off-by: Jenkins <jenkins@example.org>
