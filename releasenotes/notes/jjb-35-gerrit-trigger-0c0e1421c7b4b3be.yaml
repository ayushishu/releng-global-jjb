    Retains the expected behaviour of Gerrit Trigger job configuration
    for the comment-event-parameter-mode when a project upgrades their
    JJB to 3.5.0 or newer.

    In JJB 3.5.0 support was added to configure the
    comment-event-parameter-mode however, while it's default mode in JJB
    matches the documented help text for the configuration in Jenkins the
    Gerrit Trigger plugin itself appears to default to PLAIN mode when
    the parameter is excluded. This patch retains what we expect to be the
    default behaviour.
