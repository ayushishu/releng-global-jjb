fixes:
  - |
    Drop jobs gerrit-python-xc-clm and github-python-xc-clm from
    the two python job groups. Those templates were replaced by
    gerrit-tox-nexus-iq-clm and github-tox-nexus-iq-clm. Not adding
    those templates to the job groups because successful use requires
    additional project configuration to report the package requirements.

upgrade:
  - |
    Before upgrading to this version of global-jjb, must remove any uses
    of the job templates named above.  These jobs did not yield any results,
    so it's unlikely they were being used, and dropping them entirely
    should not cause any loss of information.
