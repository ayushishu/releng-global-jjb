    Revise tox-run.sh to guard against glob matching no tox log files.
    In that case the pattern is passed to the cp command, which fails.
    Detect the cp failure ('cp: cannot stat ..') and exit the loop.
    This new and undesired behavior was introduced by adding -e in
    change 76a0761, so the script stops when the cp command fails.
