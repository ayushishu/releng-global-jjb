issues:
  - |
    git-review tries to copy commit-msg hook to submodules with incorrect
    source file path (.git/hooks/commit-msg) and fails - the path should
    be ../.git/hooks/commit-msg if a relative path is used since the copy
    command is run in the submodule directory
  - |
    lf-activate-venv creates a virtual environment in the current working
    directory where lf-activate-venv is run. This clutters the repository
    and all the files for the virtual environment are added for update.

fixes:
  - |
    Set 'core.hooksPath' with the absolute path of the top-level hooks directory
    so that the correct source path can be used regardless of the working directory.
  - |
    Use the correct command depending on the $install_args value to avoid
    creating an additional virtual environment in the current working directory.
