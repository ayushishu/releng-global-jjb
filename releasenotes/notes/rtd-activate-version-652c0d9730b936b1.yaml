    Fixed logic for discovering new branches
    When a new branch exists on gerrit, but has never been seen by RTD
    we need to trigger a job so that the branch is discovered
    we can then mark it active in the following step.
    API changed under out feet, where a 404 was returned before
    we now get a 200 with the string null.
    Change code to explicitly match the returned string of
    "null"
