    Jenkins Job Builder 4.1.0 is now the default version. global-jjb has been
    pegged to version 2.8.0 since v0.55.3 released on 2020-07-21. Since this
    release JJB has dropped support for Python 2.7 and version 4.1.0 of JJB has
    required fixes needed for dealing with versions of plugins that are now
    shipping for Jenkins that cause issues.

    Projects that set override their JJB version should either remove the pin
    and take what global-jjb defaults to, or reset their pin to 4.1.0
