    SBOM's path flag does not work as expected. We need to introduce a new
    flag called SBOM_PATH to isolate the path where SBOM is going to be
    extracted to and executed from. By default this is set to $WORKSPACE but
    some projects need to execute the sbom from a different location in their
    code. See https://github.com/opensbom-generator/spdx-sbom-generator/issues/227
