    Our Sigul bridges now have publicly accessible DNS names, so it is no longer
    necessary to create an entry in the hosts file. Since this process relies
    on up-to-date IP addresses being configured in each project's global env
    vars, it can cause avoidable errors. It is therefore being removed.
