    Un-pin tox version from 3.27.1 and remove tox-pyenv. Testing has
    demonstrated that tox-pyenv is no longer required to obtain correct
    Python runtime versions when running tests. Also, removed Python 3.8
    from the VENV setup where it was being specifically requested.

    Due to unpinning of the tox version, tox.ini configuration files may
    need modifying to reflect a change in configuration syntax; where
    whitelist_externals needs to be replaced with allowlist_externals.
