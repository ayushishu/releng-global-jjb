    Document the jjb-verify feature that checks build-node labels named
    in JJB YAML files against nodes in cloud config files.
    Change the feature's JJB configuration variables to share a prefix.
    Improve the shell script to be robust to errors such as a suffix of
    ".cfg" or an external label of "" (just two double quotes).
