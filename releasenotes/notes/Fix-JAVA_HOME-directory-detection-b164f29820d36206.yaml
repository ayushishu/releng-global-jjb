    OpenDaylight jenkins maven jobs with jdk17 and CentOS7 currently fails
    with a confusing message stating that the JAVA_HOME variable is not
    correctly set.
    This can happen in various cases, usually when there is a mismatch
    between the jdk used by maven and the folder pointed by JAVA_HOME.
    It appears that openjdk17 is not available with CentOS7 and that
    the folder indeed does not exist
issues:
  - |
    Current message (JAVA_HOME variable is not set) is confusing and can lead
    to erroneous interpretations.
fixes:
  - |
    Add a folder existence check in related script before propagating
    JAVA_HOME variable to other scripts.
    If no folder was found, try to find an approaching solution  and exit in
    case of failure with a more relevant error message.
other:
  - |
    Adapt and refactor code consequently to be more agnostic to  distribution
    and jdk installation specificities
